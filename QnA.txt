1. To test the code:
To test this code, you'll need to set up a testing environment where you can simulate HTTP requests to your Flask application.

Write tests using a testing framework:
Use a testing framework like pytest along with Flask's built-in testing client to create your tests. Create a test_flask_app.py file:


import io
import json
import pytest
from your_flask_app import app, db, FileData, EmployeeData

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    app.config['TESTING'] = True
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///:memory:'
    with app.test_client() as client:
        with app.app_context():
            db.create_all()
        yield client

def test_upload_file(client):
    data = {
        'file': (io.BytesIO(b'date,hours worked,employee id,job group\n01/07/2023,8,emp1,A\n02/07/2023,8,emp1,A'), 'test.csv')
    }
    response = client.post('/upload', content_type='multipart/form-data', data=data)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert b'File successfully uploaded and saved' in response.data

def test_view_file(client):
    # First, upload a file to be viewed
    data = {
        'file': (io.BytesIO(b'date,hours worked,employee id,job group\n01/07/2023,8,emp1,A\n02/07/2023,8,emp1,A'), 'test.csv')
    }
    client.post('/upload', content_type='multipart/form-data', data=data)
    
    response = client.get('/view/test.csv')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert b'File is present' in response.data

def test_retrieve_report(client):
    # Upload a file first
    data = {
        'file': (io.BytesIO(b'date,hours worked,employee id,job group\n01/07/2023,8,emp1,A\n16/07/2023,8,emp2,B'), 'test.csv')
    }
    client.post('/upload', content_type='multipart/form-data', data=data)

    response = client.get('/getData')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = json.loads(response.data)
    assert len(data) == 2  # Verify the number of entries

def test_payroll_report(client):
    # Upload a file first
    data = {
        'file': (io.BytesIO(b'date,hours worked,employee id,job group\n01/07/2023,8,emp1,A\n16/07/2023,8,emp2,B'), 'test.csv')
    }
    client.post('/upload', content_type='multipart/form-data', data=data)

    response = client.get('/payroll_report')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    payroll_report = json.loads(response.data)
    assert 'payrollReport' in payroll_report
    assert 'employeeReports' in payroll_report['payrollReport']
    assert len(payroll_report['payrollReport']['employeeReports']) == 2  # Verify the number of reports




Run tests:
pytest test_flask_app.py





2. If this application was destined for a production environment, what would you add or change?
When preparing a Flask application for a production environment, several best practices and additional configurations should be implemented to ensure security, reliability, and scalability. Here are some key changes and additions:

a. Use a Production-Ready Web Server:
Instead of the built-in Flask server, use a production-ready server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.


b. Database Configuration:
Use a robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of SQLite. Update the database URI in your configuration.

c. Environment Variables:
Store sensitive configurations such as database URIs, secret keys, and other credentials in environment variables or a vault.

d. Error Handling:
Implement error handling to manage unexpected errors gracefully and provide appropriate responses.

e. Logging:
Configure logging to keep track of application behavior and errors.

f. Documentation
Provide comprehensive documentation for your API endpoints, including example requests and responses. Use tools like Swagger or Postman for API documentation.





3. What compromises did you have to make as a result of the time constraints of this challenge?

Given the time constraints of this challenge, there are several areas where compromises might have been made:

a. Simplified Error Handling:
Ideally, error handling would be more comprehensive, with custom error handlers for different types of errors.

b. Basic Input Validation:
More thorough validation would include checking the file content format and structure, not just the file extension.

c. Minimal Tests:
Extensive testing would include edge cases, invalid inputs, and performance tests.

d. Basic Database Configuration:
For production, a more robust database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL would be used.
